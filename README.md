This is a practice using [HighCharts.js](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts) to draw a polygon with every integer points inside that polygon

## Install and run on local environment

Run `npm i && npm run dev`, then webpack-dev-server will listen on __8080__ port and watch every changes on __src__ folder

## Build files 

Run `npm run build`, then webpack will build files inside __src__ folder. Finally webpack will create a __dist__ folder to contain `bundle.js` and `vendor.js`
